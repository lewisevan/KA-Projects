                <h3>How do I report inappropriate content or abusive behavior?</h3>
                <p>If you happen to come across inappropriate, low quality, or spam posts or programs (hopefully you wont!), you can report the offending content by flagging the post or program. A Guardian (moderator) will then review the offending content and remove it if it violates our <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002941867-What-are-Khan-Academy-s-Community-Guidelines-" target="_blank">Community Guidelines</a> or Program Guidelines (located under all programs).<br><br>If you come across any content you believe requires urgent attention (mass spam, threats, extensive profanity, etc.), please <a href="https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=261008">report the user via the Help Center</a> for a faster resolution time.<br><br>For privacy and documentation purposes, all reports of inappropriate user behavior need to be processed through the official channels (flags and support tickets). Please do not report users by posting on Guardians' program---we receive a lot of notifications and likely won't see it.</p>

                <h3>What do the flag categories mean?</h3>
                <p>When flagging posts/programs, you will see a selection of flag types to choose from. It is important that you select the correct flag type, since this helps us to quickly identify how the post/program breaks our guidelines.</p>
                <p>Here are the flag types for discussion posts and what they mean:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abuse -</strong>Disrespectful to other users, offensive, or inappropriate</li>
                    <li><strong>Tip or Thanks -</strong>Post should be in the Tips & Thanks (it's a comment or feedback, but not a question)</li>
                    <li><strong>Question -</strong>Post in Tips & Thanks, but is a question about the content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not helpful -</strong>Low quality posts, unspecific posts, not about the video topic, a homework question, spam posts, solciting votes/badges, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>About the site -</strong>Post is a general site question or a technical issue</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When flagging programs, you will also see a text box where you can write a comment about why you are flagging the program. Here are the flag types for programs and how they should be used: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abuse -</strong> Inappropriate content, or any other content that breaks the "Offensive" section of the Program Guidelines. Please include a quote of the inappropriate content or a description of the program when flagging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plagiarism - </strong>Copy/pasted code from another user without saving as a spin-off (Including just the link is not the same as saving as a spin-off). However, a link and comments is appropriate credit for only small code blocks taken from other projects. Please include a link to the original program when flagging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Soliciting votes - </strong>Messages or comments that ask others to vote up the project, to share the project with others, or to reach certain "vote goals". Please include a quote of the vote soliciting message and the line number it is on when flagging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Off-topic - </strong>Programs that do not belong on the Hot List (subscription pages, club pages, memes, message programs, etc.) or programs that distract from the learning environment (social clubs, controversial topics, etc.).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>I reported a post or program, but it hasn't been removed yet. How can I ensure it gets removed?</h3>
                <p>Due to the small size of our team, reported content may take a few days to be reviewed and removed. However, as long as you have reported the offending content through the appropriate channels, it will eventually come across our radar. <br><br>If you come across anything strikingly offensive and it has not been removed within 24 hours, please submit a support ticket so the incident can be escalated.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3>My program was hidden... how do I find out why or request that it be unhidden?</h3>
                <p>If you suspect that your program has been hidden from public view, please consult the Program Guidelines to identify if your program complies with the guidelines. <br><br>Once you have corrected the guideline-breaking aspects of your program (or if you were not able to determine why your program was hidden), please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8sOJPtzuYKxO12juR-G_7hFJXW-Jkt_zLD3JxMg3FuGvX5w/viewform">Hidden CS Project Appeal form</a>. A Guardian will then review your case and contact you with further information. All requests about hidden programs should be placed through the above form. Please do not comment on Guardians' programs asking for your project to be unhidden---we won't respond.<br><br>NOTE: If the program was hidden when your account was banned, we will not be able to unhide the program---having programs hidden is part of the ban. However, you are still able to repost hidden programs after your account is unbanned (provided that they follow the guidelines).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3>My account was banned... how do I find out why or request that it be unbanned?</h3>
                <p>If you suspect that your account has been banned, please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfT5mvSaMjLi9KoD3eKeypijof_2-t4__howlKHQiu2Voy9KQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">Ban Appeal form</a>. A Guardian will then review your case and contact you with further information.<br><br>Note: Please make sure to review your discussion history and delete off-topic posts before submitting the  Ban Appeal form. Additionally, please do not use other accounts or your bio to communicate while banned, as this may lengther your ban period.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3>My friend was banned, can you you tell me why?</h3>
                <p>Due to the sake of user privacy, we cannot disclose any information about actions taken on others' accounts. If a friend has been banned, it is best to direct them to the Ban Appeal and cease conversations with them (helping banned users evade their account restrictions may lead to your own account being banned).<br><br>Please do not submit a support ticket for friends that have been banned or ask staff/Guardians about the situation---we will not respond.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h3>My program was hidden, but a similar program wasn't. What gives?</h3>
                <p>If your program was hidden, but a similar program is still visible, it is likely because the visible program has not yet been reported/reviewed. We try our best to enforce the guidelines fairly, but due to our limited resources and small team we are not able to review all reported content at the same time. If you see a program that you think should be hidden, please flag it and we will try to review it as soon as possible.</p>
